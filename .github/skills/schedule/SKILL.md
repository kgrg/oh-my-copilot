# Schedule

Use `/schedule` to register, inspect, or remove **durable local cron jobs**. Each
job spawns a fresh non-interactive agent session at its interval, survives
machine restart (via the OS scheduler — launchd / systemd / crontab), and writes
results back to the project so the next session sees them.

This is the in-session front-end to the `omp schedule` CLI. You (the agent) run
the `omp schedule …` commands on the user's behalf.

**Listing & inspecting existing jobs** — if the user just wants to see, inspect, or
remove jobs (not create one), route straight to the CLI; do NOT reach for
`crontab`/`launchctl`:
- List all jobs: `omp schedule list [--json]`
- Inspect one job's status + recent results: `omp schedule status --id <id> [--json]`
- Remove a job: `omp schedule remove --id <id>`

## When to use

- The user wants something to run on a repeat: "check the PR every 15 minutes",
  "run the tests nightly", "poll the deployment hourly".
- The work should keep happening after the terminal closes and across reboots.

## Do not use when

- The user wants a one-shot task now — just do it.
- The user wants to keep iterating within this session — use `/ralph` or `/loop`.

## Steps

1. **Clarify** the prompt to run and the cadence (turn natural language into a
   5-field cron expression, local time). E.g. "every 15 min" → `*/15 * * * *`;
   "weekdays at 9am" → `0 9 * * 1-5`.
2. **Decide tool access.** By default jobs run WITHOUT `--allow-all-tools`, so the
   unattended agent is limited to read-only/allowlisted tools. If the job must
   act (edit files, run commands, push), add `--allow-all-tools` and confirm with
   the user first — it runs unattended with full access.
3. **Register** the job:
   ```bash
   omp schedule add --id <id> --cron "<expr>" --prompt "<text>" \
     [--allow-all-tools] [--cwd <dir>] [--model <m>] [--timeout <ms>] \
     [--max-runs <n>] [--ttl-hours <h>] \
     [--notify-target slack:<ID>] [--notify-desktop] [--notify-open-omp] --json
   ```
   Jobs auto-expire after 72h by default (`--ttl-hours`) — set a longer TTL or a
   `--max-runs` cap as needed. Use `--dry-run` to preview the OS entry first.

   **End-of-run notifications (all opt-in, default off; failures never affect the job):**
   - `--notify-target slack:<C|G|D|U…>` — post the run summary to Slack (needs
     `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`; falls back to `SLACK_HOME_CHANNEL` when no target).
   - `--notify-desktop` — fire a native desktop notification (job id + status +
     one-line summary). Transport per OS: **macOS → `osascript`** (the only path
     that reliably displays on Sequoia; shown under "Script Editor", **not
     clickable**); **Linux/Windows → node-notifier** (notify-send / SnoreToast).
   - `--notify-open-omp` — make the notification's click open an interactive `omp`
     session in the schedule state root (the SessionStart banner then surfaces the
     latest result). **Requires a click-capable transport**, which on macOS means a
     system `terminal-notifier` enabled via `OMP_NOTIFY_USE_TERMINAL_NOTIFIER=1`
     (`brew install terminal-notifier`). Note: terminal-notifier does **not**
     display on some macOS Sequoia builds — if notifications stop appearing,
     unset that env to fall back to osascript (display-only). Disable desktop
     notifications entirely with `OMP_DISABLE_DESKTOP_NOTIFY=1`.

   Slack and desktop are independent and can be combined on one job.
4. **Confirm** by listing: `omp schedule list --json`.
5. **Trigger now** to test it once: `omp schedule run-now --id <id>`.
6. **Inspect** results: `omp schedule status --id <id> --json` (recent results
   are also surfaced automatically at the start of future sessions). To pull up
   the latest run with full context by id — e.g. after seeing a desktop
   notification titled `schedule: <id>` — run `omp schedule open <id>`, which
   prints the latest status, summary, and the full captured output. Add `--tmux`
   to instead drop into an interactive `omp` session (auto-wrapped in tmux) rooted
   at the project; the SessionStart banner surfaces *recent* scheduled runs there
   (not pinned to `<id>`) — for this id's exact output, use plain `omp schedule open <id>`.
7. **Remove** when done: `omp schedule remove --id <id>` (fully uninstalls the OS
   entry; do NOT delete `.omp/state/schedule/` by hand).

## Safety

- Scheduled runs are unattended. Keep prompts specific and bounded.
- `--allow-all-tools` grants full tool access with no human in the loop — opt in
  deliberately, scope the `--cwd`, and prefer a `--max-runs`/`--ttl-hours` cap.
- Overlapping runs are prevented automatically (one run per job at a time), and
  every run is killed at its `--timeout` (default 5 min).

## Examples

```bash
# Babysit a PR every 15 minutes, read-only, for 24 hours
omp schedule add --id pr-watch --cron "*/15 * * * *" \
  --prompt "Check open PRs on this repo and summarize any new review comments." \
  --ttl-hours 24

# Nightly test run that may fix things (full access), capped at 7 runs
omp schedule add --id nightly-tests --cron "0 2 * * *" \
  --prompt "Run the test suite; if anything fails, open an issue with the log." \
  --allow-all-tools --max-runs 7
```

## Cost/token note

This skill can drive multiple tool calls or long-running output. Use `omp cost [--today] [--session <id>]` for local hook-ledger estimates only; it is not provider billing. Keep injected summaries concise and prefer bounded output when rerunning noisy commands.
