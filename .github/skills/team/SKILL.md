# Team — tmux-based parallel agent execution

`/team` launches independent Copilot CLI agents in parallel tmux panes.

**Default behavior:** use the **split-window** flow so the user sees agents working in the current tmux window.

Use **runtime mode** (`omp team`) only when the user explicitly asks for background execution, detached monitoring, or runtime APIs like status, nudging, or worker messaging.

Two modes available:

| Mode | Command | Panes visible in | Best for |
|------|---------|-------------------|----------|
| **Split** | `team-launch.sh` | Current window | **Default**. Visual demo, watching agents work |
| **Runtime** | `omp team N:copilot "task"` | Separate tmux session | Explicit background jobs, task tracking, nudging, messaging |

## When to use

- Work has **independent lanes** (no shared files, no ordering constraints)
- You want parallel execution in split terminals

## Default mode — Split window (`team-launch.sh`)

Use this unless the user asks for background execution.

### When to choose it

- The user wants to **see** the agents working
- You want panes in the **current tmux window**
- You are demoing or smoke-testing the skill

### Step 1 — Write lanes JSON

Write a temporary file at `/tmp/team-lanes-<timestamp>.json`:

```json
[
  { "id": "lane-a", "name": "Short name", "prompt": "Complete self-contained task prompt..." },
  { "id": "lane-b", "name": "Another lane", "prompt": "Another task prompt..." }
]
```

### Step 2 — Launch

```bash
bash ~/.copilot/installed-plugins/oh-my-copilot/oh-my-copilot/.github/skills/team/scripts/team-launch.sh \
  --session "team-<name>" --lanes <lanes-file>
```

The script:
1. Splits the **current window** into panes
2. Launches `omp --madmax` in each
3. Auto-accepts folder trust prompts
4. Waits for readiness, sends prompts
5. Monitors completion and prints a results summary

### Step 3 — Report

The script blocks and prints all results. Relay the output to the user.

## Optional mode — Runtime (`omp team`)

Choose this only when the user explicitly wants the team to run in the background or needs runtime features.

### When to choose it

- The user asked for a **background** team
- You need `omp team status`, shutdown, or runtime task APIs
- You do **not** need the panes in the current tmux window

### Launch

```bash
omp team <N>:copilot "<task description>"
```

The runtime automatically:
1. Creates a tmux session with split panes
2. Launches `copilot --allow-all-tools` in each pane
3. Auto-accepts folder trust prompts
4. Waits for readiness, then sends the task prompt
5. Tracks task state, heartbeats, and supports idle-nudging

### Monitor and cleanup

```bash
omp team status <team-name>       # check progress
tmux attach -t omp-team-<name>    # watch panes live
omp team shutdown <team-name>     # kill when done
```

## Prerequisites

- `tmux` installed and session running
- `omp` on PATH
- `jq` for JSON parsing (split mode only)

## Task / prompt guidelines

Each task must be **self-contained**. The agent has no context from this session. Include:
- Exact files or directories to work in
- What to do (fix, upgrade, etc.)
- How to verify (run tests, etc.)
- Commit message to use

### Good example

> In src/auth/login.ts, replace bcrypt with argon2. Update the import, change the verify call, run `npm test -- --grep auth`. Commit: "refactor: switch to argon2".

### Bad example

> Fix the auth module. (Too vague)

## Composition

Use `/ralplan` before `/team` to produce the plan. Use `/verify` after completion.

## Limitations

- Each pane is an independent session — no shared state
- Workers can message each other via `omp team api send-message` (runtime mode only)
- If tasks depend on each other, use `/ralph` instead
