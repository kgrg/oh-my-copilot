# Copilot skill distribution

Use the agent-skill package shape as the default install surface:

```text
skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
skills/<skill-name>/references/*
skills/<skill-name>/scripts/*
skills/<skill-name>/assets/*
```

For Copilot project install, copy the skill directory to:

```text
.github/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
```

For Copilot personal install, copy the skill directory to:

```text
~/.copilot/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
```

The catalog is optional metadata for this repository's built-in general skill list. Copilot discovers skills from the skill directories themselves.

## Native oh-my-copilot installer

Use `omc skill install` when you want the same simple OMC-style copy flow, or as a fallback on machines without a new enough GitHub CLI:

```bash
omc skill install ./skills/my-skill --dry-run
omc skill install ./skills/my-skill --root /path/to/repo
omc skill install ./skills/my-skill --scope user
```

The installer validates `SKILL.md` frontmatter, previews copied files with `--dry-run`, preserves optional resource folders, and writes to `.github/skills/<name>` by default.

## GitHub CLI path

GitHub documents `gh skill` for searching, previewing, installing, updating, and publishing skills. It requires GitHub CLI `2.90.0` or newer.

Useful commands:

```bash
gh skill preview OWNER/REPOSITORY SKILL
gh skill install OWNER/REPOSITORY SKILL
gh skill install OWNER/REPOSITORY SKILL --scope user
gh skill publish --dry-run
```

Local note: this machine has `gh 2.92.0`, so `gh skill` is available. Do not make `gh skill` the only install path; keep `omc skill install` as the fallback and repo-native dry-run surface.

## OMC-like installer shape

The `oh-my-copilot` installer should stay thin:

1. Fetch a skill directory from a GitHub repository.
2. Validate `SKILL.md` frontmatter: `name` and `description`.
3. Preview the file tree before writing.
4. Copy the directory unchanged to `.github/skills/<name>` for project scope or `~/.copilot/skills/<name>` for user scope.
5. Preserve optional `references/`, `scripts/`, and `assets/`.
6. Write provenance metadata only if needed for updates; do not require catalog entries.

Dry-run output should show the target path and files that would be written.

## Not a GitHub App Copilot Extension

GitHub App-based Copilot Extensions are not the right path for this repo. GitHub sunset that extension type in favor of MCP servers: new creation was blocked in September 2025 and existing GitHub App-based Copilot Extensions were disabled in November 2025.

If this project later needs live tools beyond static skills, prefer an MCP server. If it needs IDE UI integration, consider a VS Code extension. Keep project skills as plain skill packages.
