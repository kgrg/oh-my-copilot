Two valid sources: (a) the user CORRECTED your behavior (e.g. 'stop doing X', 'too verbose', 'you always Y'), or (b) an established PROJECT CONVENTION/rule observed this session (e.g. 'use pnpm not npm', 'never run lint:fix', a required import style).

Empty unless a correction or a standing preference/convention is clearly evidenced.",

Anchor each claim to what you actually OBSERVED in this session — do not over-generalize beyond the evidence (e.g. don't claim 'X is never done in components' from one example). Do NOT save session-outcome facts: what files changed this session, commit SHAs, PR/issue numbers, 'tests passed', task-completion status, file counts, or anything that will be stale in 7 days. If it will be stale in 7 days, it is NOT a note. Phrase every note as a TIMELESS present-tense fact about how things ARE — never what changed this session: do NOT record transient/in-progress states (e.g. 'X was temporarily disabled because Y didn't exist yet') or 'a new file was added/introduced'. State the durable fact ('sliceHelpers.ts provides withAsyncState/withTimeout'), not the session event ('sliceHelpers.ts was added'). Must-follow rules belong in directives, not notes.",

The procedure must be reusable on its own — NOT a session-specific execution plan, a refactor checklist for this one change, a current to-do list, or steps tied to the exact files/slice-names/architecture of this session.
